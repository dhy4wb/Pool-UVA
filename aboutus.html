  <p class = "moved">Our website, Pool@UVA, is a carpool website specifically made for UVA students. Users will be able to create accounts, search for rides as “riders”, and post rides on the website as “drivers”. Riders and drivers will be matched together based on destination and departure date. Once matched together, the users will be able to connect with each other and exchange further details about the arranged ride. </p>
